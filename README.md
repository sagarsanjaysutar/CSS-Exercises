# CSS Exercises

This repository contains exercises, projects, and notes based on lessons learned from the Frontend Joe's book titled [Learn CSS by Use Cases](https://frontendjoe.gumroad.com/l/learn-css-by-use-cases). I have showcased advanced CSS, mastering pseudo-classes, transitions & animations to craft engaging UI components.

### Future Todo:

I started reading this book on 28th April, 2025 & completed the entire book on 5th May, 2025. Following are some of the future projects:

1.  Implement `user-select: none` in a component to prevents accidental selection.
2.  Play around with `flex grow, flex shrink, flex basis`.
3.  Learn about 3D CSS. Create the Futuristic dropdown from: usecases/extra-instagram-content.html
4.  Implement Smooth CSS Gradiant Animation (Its not straightforward as it sounds).
